# What does your robot do?
## Collects information about its surroundings, discards it, and runs into walls

<!SLIDE incremental bullets>
# Input
* Any signals that come into the robot
* Digital
* Analog

<!SLIDE incremental bullets>
# Why
* So we know what our surroundings are
* So we can react to changes
* Awareness

<!SLIDE incremental bullets>
# Analog
* Signals with a range of values
* Represented with a varying voltage

<!SLIDE incremental small bullets>
# Examples
* Rotation of a joint
* Temperature
* Light intensity
* Rate of rotation

<!SLIDE incremental bullets>
# Digital 
* Signals that are either on or off
* Varying thresholds for on/off

<!SLIDE incremental bullets>
# Examples
* Limit switch
* Encoder
* Banner Sensor

<!SLIDE incremental bullets>
# About Signals
* All signals in your robot are stored digitally
* Analog -> Digital conversion
